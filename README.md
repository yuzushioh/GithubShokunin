## Setup

### üîë Slack Bot Config

Once you create a bot in slack configration, place its token and name in `Config/bot-config.json`.

When it is runing on your mac, the file should look like this!

```json
{
    "token": "xoxo-2h4j43n5g3i2mn24g",
    "bot_name": "GithubShokunin"
}
```

When you deploy, use environmental variables instead! so it should look like this.

```json
{
    "token": "$BOT_TOKEN",
    "bot_name": "$BOT_NAME"
}
```
